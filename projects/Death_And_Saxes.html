<p><em>Death and Saxes</em> is a platforming game I contributed to as part of a month-long Game Jam as part of UH Mānoa’s Game Dev club. The theme was “invisible platforms,” and the game idea we came up with is that the player is a melodica player whose notes can reveal or shatter invisible platforms. The antagonist is a saxaboom player named Jack Blanc, who has turned the main character into a melodica and then stolen some of their keys. As the player gets more of their melodica’s keys back, they will be able to interact with more platforms.</p>

<p>The game will be coded in the Unity engine (not to be confused with the Ubuntu desktop) with scripts that use the C# language. This was not be my first time using the Unity engine, but it will be the first time I have done so under Linux. This sadly led to issues where, thanks to a lack of communication, I was not able to contribute much in the way of code. Additionally, since the choice to use Unity was made just before Unity Technologies’s bone-headed idea to tax developers per download of games after a certain point, I felt uneasy using the engine, suggesting the use of libre software after this project.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I was able to provide ideas during the initial development, coming up with the title, the premiss, and the musical theming.</p>
