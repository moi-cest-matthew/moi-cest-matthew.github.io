*Death and Saxes* is a platforming game I contributed to as part of a month-long Game Jam as part of UH Mānoa's Game Dev club. The theme was "invisible platforms," and the game idea we came up with is that the player is a melodica player whose notes can reveal or shatter invisible platforms. The antagonist is a saxaboom player named Jack Blanc, who has turned the main character into a melodica and then stolen some of their keys. As the player gets more of their melodica's keys back, they will be able to interact with more platforms.

The game will be coded in the Unity engine (not to be confused with the Ubuntu desktop) with scripts that use the C# language. This was not be my first time using the Unity engine, but it will be the first time I have done so under Linux. This sadly led to issues where, thanks to a lack of communication, I was not able to contribute much in the way of code. Additionally, since the choice to use Unity was made just before Unity Technologies's bone-headed idea to tax developers per download of games after a certain point, I felt uneasy using the engine, suggesting the use of libre software after this project.

Fortunately, I was able to provide ideas during the initial development, coming up with the title, the premiss, and the musical theming.
