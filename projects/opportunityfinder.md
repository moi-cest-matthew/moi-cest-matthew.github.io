summary: "I helped mock up a website to make finding UH internships easier, whether for students or employees."
---
As part of the final project in my ICS 314 class, I worked together with three other people to create Opportunity Finder, a mockup of a website that aims to make it easier for computing students in Hawaii to find internships, as well as for companies to find the best students for said internships. 

The problem it aims to solve is the lack of easily accessible information that students and companies have about each other. They both also have different expectations that they need to reconcile and reality-check. When this gap is not closed, finding internships appears harder than it actually is for students and providing them becomes harder for companies.

The way Opportunity Finder is designed to live up to its name is by allowing students and companies to create and search for profiles containing information such as which island the user is on or what skills are involved.

While this project is a mere mockup, I did learn valuable lessons about version management in general. I got used to using IntelliJ to update and create branches, using the project feature of GitHub to organize tasks, as well as handling my first merge conflicts. This was my first taste of real world experience and I am excited for more.
