*Melodica Man* is a tentative title for a platforming game I am coding for as part of a month-long Game Jam as part of UH Mānoa's Game Dev club. The theme was "invisible platforms," and the game idea we came up with is that the player is a melodica player whose notes can reveal or shatter invisible platforms. The antagonist is a saxaboom named Jacques Blanc, who has stolen some of the keys off the main character's melodica. As the player gets more of their melodica's keys back, they will be able to interact with more platforms.

The game will be coded in the Unity engine (not to be confused with the Ubuntu desktop) with scripts that use the C# language. This will not be my first time using the Unity engine, but it will be the first time I have done so under Linux. While an unfortunately large chunk of game development is Windows-only, the scope of this project is likely too small to have to worry about Windows-specific libraries festering their way in.


A link to the game will appear here when it is finished.
