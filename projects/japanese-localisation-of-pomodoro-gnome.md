summary: "I am localising a Pomodoro timer program into Japanese."

Pomodoro is a program made by Arun Mahaprata and currently maintained by Kamil Prushko. As the name plainly states, it is an electronic Pomodoro timer, which helps its user to split their work time and break time healthily. That way, the two do not bleed into each other.

With that said, as with many Linux applications, it did not support the Japanese language when I first downloaded it. In fact, many Linux applications are likelier to support the much less spoken Dutch and Catalan, whose speakers likely know the much more spoken English and Spanish, respectively. Luckily, the spirit of free and open source software is that anyone who speaks Japanese is free to translate if they so choose, as opposed to being stuck in limbo, forced to pray that a rightsholder licenses out a translation. Plus, with copyright out of the picture, if my translation has problems, Japanese speakers are not forced to tolerate it.
