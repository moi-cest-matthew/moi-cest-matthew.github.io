Out of the frying pan, into the fire.

After finally getting used to the workings of GitHub, I was prepared to get into HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I had heard that this would be the hardest part of software engineering I had seen so far, but when taking my first step into HTML/CSS... it was suspiciously easy.

Of course, I did have to learn how to use new languages along the way, but when I made first contact, everything was rather enjoyably simple, from the way I got to see colours and images change as I added code to making images move around. I was genuinely entertained seeing the sample project coming together, even though it was just a sample. Even seeing the penguin at the end gave me a smile.

Then there was Bootstrap.

I do understand that a framework is much like a library: why reinvent the wheel? Others have done the heavy lifting for you and are able to give it away, free for you to use. You can cut down on time and have your code look cleaner as a result. The makers even explained how to use it in their wiki. It does explain what the tools are and how you use them, as well as letting you search for each. While it is not easy to use when you are asked to use it with no idea what to look for in the middle of ADHD-induced brain fog, I do appreciate its existance.

The problem was simultaneously me and not me: because I have ADHD, trying to think about what to search for on the wiki would have burned through precious time (which for me, is as expensive as Californian gasoline) needed for getting through other important, more time-sensitive tasks, such as writing this reflection. I am genuinely happy to have AI go through these things for me; it saves both the time coding the features from scratch and the extra time from going through the English-only wiki. I do understand the need to read about the content first, but a deadline is a deadline. Explaining my condition will simply eat up more time than using the tool that gives me only the part of the wiki that I need and explains it.

I look forward to finding more ways to save time.
