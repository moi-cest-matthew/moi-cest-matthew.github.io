When it comes to solving a problem, any problem, some approaches are more tried and true than others. When learning a language like Spanish, people use patterns to help themselves conjugate verbs. For instance, since the verbs "gritar" (to shout), "editar" (to edit), and "llorar" (to cry) all end in -ar, you automatically know that to say to people you know that "you all" do each of these things, you say «gritáis», «editáis», and «lloráis».

Similarly, software designers have design patterns. These are also reusable templates, which, just as in human language, make problems understandable and therefore more solvable. Just as a Spanish verb alone needs to be conjugated in order to be complete (sometimes even a complete sentence), design patterns alone are not complete either. They can make problems easier to solve and less likely to occur by making the code easier to understand.

Much as how Spanish verbs have multiple different types, so do design patterns have different types, and thus different applications. One example is the factory pattern, a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating instances of a class, but allows subclasses to alter the type of instances that will be created. It declares an interface for creating objects, implements the factory interface and is responsible for creating concrete products, declares the interface for the objects the factory creates, and implements the product interface and represents the objects created by the factory.

Another example is the Singleton Pattern, which ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance by defining a static method to get the instance of the class.
